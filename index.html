            <h3>Seating</h3>
            <p>🏟 We are in the North stands (sections 106 -111). The seating is unassigned and standing only.</p>
            <p>🧑‍🤝‍🧑 No matter what tickets you buy in these sections we can all still be together for the game since we choose our own “seats”.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>🚗 If you plan to drive to the game, parking is charged separately at the stadium. More information <a href="https://www.intermiamicf.com/matchday/parking" target="blank">here</a>!
            <p>🚄 If you plan to take the Brightline:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Book a <b>Goal Getter</b> ticket <a href="https://www.gobrightline.com/" target="blank">here</a>! (Use code <code>MICHELLEB10</code> for a discount)</li>
                <li>If you’d like to sit together as a group on a train from West Palm Beach, let me know — I'll book the tickets together and you can Venmo me after.</li>
                <li>We will not book return tickets until the end of the game so you have the option to book an early return if you’d like, or so that we don’t have to rush if a game goes a little longer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>🚌 There's a free shuttle bus that will take us from the Brightline station to the InterMiami stadium!</p>

            <h3>Attire</h3>
            <p>👚 We are in the hardcore fan section — it’s the best place to be in the stadium hands down! With that said, it comes with a dress code and will even have the following message when you select the tickets to purchase for that section. The team colors to wear are black, pink, and white.</p>
            <code>This section is on the North Side which is Inter Miami CF Supporters Safe Standing Section. Seating is treated as General Admission within each section. During the match expect to experience loud noises, chants, smoke, and flag waving that may obstruct your view. Opposing team gear, colors, and supporters are prohibited. Sections 108 – 109 are reserved for La Familia.</code>
